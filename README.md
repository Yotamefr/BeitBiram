# Beit Biram Timetable!

Created mostly intirely by me. The Mashov API has been made by Xiddoc however I modified it for my use. I'm making this project open-sourced to prove I do not steal your data. ~~USE AT YOUR OWN RISK cause I'm not sure how secure this is. Using it locally should be fine but using the version on heroku might not be so secured. If you still want to use it, this is the link: https://beitbiram.herokuapp.com/~~ I deleted the public version cause of the fact it wasn't so secured and could be used for malicious intents if the mashov rest api doesn't have rate limit. Can be used maliciously even if it has and even if I don't publicize it, but I'd say the chances of it are lower.

## Running it

It's made in Python 3 so make sure you have that installed first. Next, you open the terminal (cmd or powershell if you have Windows) in the folder of the project after you downloaded it, and write `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if you have multiple versions of python make sure you install it with the correct pip). If you have heroku cli installed on your computer you can write `heroku local` in the terminal, if not just write `python app.py` (again, make sure you use the correct python if you have multiple versions of python) or `gunicorn app:app` (doesn't always work. Don't know why)
